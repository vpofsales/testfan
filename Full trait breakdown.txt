Core Traits are decided by each blocks' nonce, read in reverse. So the last digit of the nonce, is actually considered Digit 1 or "D1"
The next to last digit would be "D2"
Each core trait has 10 possibilities, based off the integers 0-9.



D1 is for Backgrounds:

Every type (base/arm out/female) gets the same triggers and backgrounds 
background trigger is the nonce from that specific block number, read in reverse.

9	Yellow

----------------------------------------

The next step is to check the block number to see if it gets Base/Arm Out/Female traits
If the block number is divisible by 17, then it triggers Arm Out traits.
If the reward from that block number is over 300k then it triggers Female traits. 
If both are triggered, then Arm Out overrides Female, unless its a mermaid. 

Choose Appropriate "Outline" based off info above.


If its base then draw base outline and fill with  

#9781ac (light purple)
#89ac81 (light green
#81a3ac (light blue)
#a4905f (light orange)
#ca6d6c (light red)
#b3b3b3 (light grey)
#772684 (medium purple) 


^unless Diamond or Pepe skin is triggered, which take precedence and override the base colors. 

Pepe Skin: #24bd57 also change default mouth color of black to #d31403
Diamond Skin: #b9f2ff




MERMAID TRIGGER:
FEMALE (Block reward over 300k) + Block Hash contains 00000000000000000000 (20 zeroes) 

Mermaids do not get any of the skin tones above. only the base one included in their respective svg data.
Mermaids will get their base svg and then follow the normal structure. but only for the following:
Background (rare included)
Female Eyes
Hair (only gets ponytail, but has a couple new colors)
Mouth (regular or smile)

Mermaid Tail combos:

Green (even numbers)
Top: #157c37
Bottom: #24ab4c

Purple (odd numbers)
Top: #501d8e
Bottom: #7f3cd0


Mermaid Shell Tops:

Purple: #631d95 (last digit of nonce is 0-5)
Light Blue: #48c3b1 (last digit of nonce is 6-9)


mermaid trait overrides/nulls out all other traits except for those listed above (background, eyes, hair, mouth, and dog moon if applicable)

---------------------------------------------------------

After outline and skin tone filled, next is D2. Eyes.


D2 is for Eyes. 
Base and Arm Out use the same "Core" svg vectors for eyes. 
If any "Eyewear" trait is triggered, then it overrides "Core" eyes. (only applies to "Base" arm out does not receive eyewear)
